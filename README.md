*FROM API TO INSIGHT : VISUALIZING WEATHER IN REAL TIME*

As part of my internship, Task 1 involved building a Python-based application that demonstrates the integration of an external API with data visualization. The goal was to fetch real-time weather data from a public API and use that data to create insightful visualizations using popular Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. This task helped me strengthen my practical skills in working with APIs, JSON data, and plotting tools in Python.

To achieve this, I chose the OpenWeatherMap API ‚Äî a free and widely used platform for accessing current weather data. After registering and obtaining an API key (optional for basic access), I used Python‚Äôs requests library to make a GET request to the API endpoint with a user-provided city name. The application is designed to allow the user to dynamically input any city of their choice, which enhances the flexibility and user experience of the tool.

Once the data was retrieved in JSON format, I parsed important weather details such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and weather conditions. The data was then pre-processed and organized into a readable format using Python dictionaries and lists. This structured format allowed for seamless integration with visualization tools.

The visualization part was implemented using matplotlib, one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. I created a dashboard that includes a bar chart displaying temperature, humidity, and pressure, as well as a wind speed indicator and a textual weather condition label. The visuals were designed to be easy to interpret, making it simple for users to gain quick insights about the weather conditions in their selected city. I also added proper labeling and color-coding to make the charts visually appealing and informative.

One of the best aspects of this project is that it brings together multiple real-world skills: making API calls, handling JSON data, processing user input dynamically, and displaying results in a meaningful and visually clear way. This task wasn‚Äôt just about writing code ‚Äî it was about creating a small but functional product that simulates a real-world use case.

Overall, this task helped me explore the complete cycle of data flow ‚Äî from data acquisition to data presentation ‚Äî all within a simple Python environment. It taught me how to connect external services with my own programs, and how to transform raw data into something that end users can understand and benefit from. The result is a lightweight yet powerful weather dashboard that can be further expanded with features like historical data tracking, temperature trend graphs, or even machine learning forecasts in the future.

I have made this project with the help of resources from Google, Youtube & Chatgpt. This task has significantly contributed to my understanding of API usage, data processing, and visualization principles ‚Äî three fundamental areas for any data-driven application or career in data science, machine learning, or software development.
